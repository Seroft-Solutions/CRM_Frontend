# CRM Meeting Integration - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **What We've Built**

This implementation adds intelligent meeting scheduling capabilities to your CRM system, seamlessly integrating user availability setup with customer creation and meeting scheduling with call management.

---

## üìã **Components Created**

### **1. Availability Generation Service**
**Location:** `src/app/(protected)/(features)/shared/services/availability-service.ts`

**Features:**
- Generates default 9am-7pm weekly availability with 30-minute slots
- Creates UserAvailability (recurring schedule) and AvailableTimeSlot (specific slots) records
- Intelligent conflict detection to avoid overwriting existing availability
- Configurable working days, hours, and slot duration
- Generates availability for next 30 days automatically

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { AvailabilityService, DEFAULT_AVAILABILITY_CONFIG } from './availability-service';

// Generate complete availability setup
const generated = AvailabilityService.generateCompleteAvailability(userId);

// Custom configuration
const customConfig = {
  startTime: "08:00",
  endTime: "18:00",
  slotDurationMinutes: 45,
  workingDays: [/* specific days */]
};
```

### **2. Customer Availability Setup Component**
**Location:** `src/app/(protected)/(features)/customers/components/availability/customer-availability-setup.tsx`

**Features:**
- Integrated into customer creation flow as a new step
- Checks for existing user availability to avoid duplicates
- Configurable time ranges, working days, and slot durations
- Preview of generated schedule before creation
- Batch creation of availability records with progress tracking
- Skip option for users who want to set up availability later

**Integration:** Added as "User Availability" step in customer form between Geographic and Review steps

### **3. Call Meeting Scheduler Component**
**Location:** `src/app/(protected)/(features)/calls/components/meeting-integration/call-meeting-scheduler.tsx`

**Features:**
- Wraps existing MeetingScheduler with call context
- Pre-populates meeting details from call data
- Provides choice screen (Schedule vs Skip)
- Visual feedback for successful scheduling or skipping
- Integrated error handling
- Returns to call completion flow after meeting scheduling

**Integration:** Added as "Schedule Meeting" step in call form after Review step

### **4. Meeting Integration Service**
**Location:** `src/app/(protected)/(features)/shared/services/meeting-integration-service.ts`

**Features:**
- Extracts meeting context from call data
- Validates meeting scheduling prerequisites
- Generates default meeting titles and descriptions
- Provides readiness status checking
- Handles success/error scenarios
- Creates meeting scheduling URLs with context

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **Customer Creation Flow**
1. **Basic Information** - Customer details
2. **Location Details** - Geographic information  
3. **User Availability** ‚≠ê *NEW* - Set up availability for assigned user
   - Checks if user already has availability
   - Configurable 9am-7pm schedule with 30-min slots
   - Generates next 30 days of time slots
   - Option to skip if not needed
4. **Review** - Confirm all details

### **Call Creation Flow**
1. **Classification** - Priority, call type, status
2. **Business Relations** - Customer and source
3. **Channel Details** - Channel type and parties
4. **Assignment & Date** - Assigned user and call time
5. **Review** - Confirm call details
6. **Schedule Meeting** ‚≠ê *NEW* - Optional follow-up meeting
   - Choice: Schedule Now vs Schedule Later
   - Uses existing MeetingScheduler if choosing to schedule
   - Pre-populates with call context
   - Links meeting to the call record

---

## üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

### **Default Availability Configuration**
```typescript
{
  startTime: "09:00",
  endTime: "19:00", 
  slotDurationMinutes: 30,
  workingDays: [MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY],
  timeZone: "Auto-detected"
}
```

### **Customization**
- Working hours can be adjusted per user
- Slot duration is configurable (15-120 minutes)
- Working days can be customized
- Skip options available for both availability and meeting setup

---

## üîß **Backend Integration**

The implementation uses your existing JDL entities:

### **UserAvailability Entity**
- `dayOfWeek` - MONDAY through SUNDAY
- `startTime/endTime` - HH:MM format
- `isAvailable` - Boolean flag
- `effectiveFrom/effectiveTo` - Date ranges
- `user` - Link to UserProfile

### **AvailableTimeSlot Entity**  
- `slotDateTime` - Specific date/time
- `duration` - Slot duration in minutes
- `isBooked` - Booking status
- `user` - Link to UserProfile

### **Meeting Entity**
- Links to Call via `call` relationship
- Links to Customer via `assignedCustomer`
- Links to User via `organizer`
