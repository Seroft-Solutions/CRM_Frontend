 * Main entry point for the Call form.
 * This component uses the new modular, config-driven form architecture.
 *
 * To modify the form structure, update the configuration in:
 * - form/call-form-config.ts (generated from templates)
 *
 * The form configuration controls:
 * - Step order and field grouping
 * - Validation rules
 * - Relationship dependencies and cascading filters
 * - UI behavior and styling
 *
 * This approach ensures consistency across all entity forms while maintaining
 * full customization capabilities through configuration rather than code changes.
