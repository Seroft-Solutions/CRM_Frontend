## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Code Generation System
- **Entity Generation**: Auto-generates CRUD pages, forms, and components
- **API Client Generation**: TypeScript clients from OpenAPI specs
- **Template-based**: Consistent patterns across all features

### Key Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build              # Production build
npm run lint               # ESLint checks
npm run format             # Prettier formatting

# API & Code Generation  
npm run sync               # Full sync: fetch OpenAPI, generate types, sync entities
npm run openapi:fetch      # Fetch OpenAPI spec from backend
npm run openapi:generate   # Generate TypeScript API clients
npm run generate-nextjs    # Generate Next.js entities and components
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (To Be Implemented)

### Current State
- **No existing test infrastructure**
- **No Jest or Playwright setup**
- **Manual testing only**

### Required Implementation
1. **Unit Testing with Jest**
   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - Service and hook testing
   - API client testing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Form submission flows
   - API integration tests
   - Authentication flow testing

3. **End-to-End Testing with Playwright**
   - Complete user workflows
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Visual regression testing

## 🚀 Next Phase: Realtime Collaboration

### Missing Capabilities
The current system lacks realtime collaboration features, which are essential for modern CRM systems where multiple users work on the same data simultaneously.

### Realtime Collaboration Requirements
1. **Real-time Data Synchronization**
   - Live updates for customer data changes
   - Meeting schedule synchronization
   - Call status updates

2. **User Presence Indicators**
   - Show who is currently viewing/editing records
   - Online/offline status
   - Active session tracking

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Optimistic updates with rollback
   - Merge conflict handling
   - Data versioning

4. **Live Notifications**
   - Real-time alerts for important changes
   - Meeting reminders and updates
   - System notifications

5. **Collaborative Editing**
   - Multiple users editing simultaneously
   - Real-time form synchronization
   - Lock management for critical operations

## 🎯 Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure
1. Set up Jest with React Testing Library
2. Configure Playwright for E2E testing
3. Create test utilities and helpers
4. Implement basic test coverage

### Phase 2: Realtime Foundation
1. Set up WebSocket/Server-Sent Events infrastructure
2. Implement real-time data synchronization
3. Add user presence tracking
4. Create notification system

### Phase 3: Collaborative Features
1. Real-time form editing
2. Conflict resolution mechanisms
3. Live customer/call updates
4. Meeting schedule synchronization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Advanced notification system
2. Audit trail and activity logs
3. Performance optimization
4. Monitoring and analytics

## 📚 Design Principles

### Small Component Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composable**: Components can be easily combined
- **Reusable**: Generic components for common patterns
- **Testable**: Easy to test in isolation

### File Organization
- Feature-based directory structure
- Shared components in dedicated directories
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Automated code generation where possible
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for mobile devices
2. **Offline Support**: PWA capabilities with offline data sync
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Reporting and dashboard enhancements
4. **AI Integration**: Smart scheduling and customer insights
5. **API Versioning**: Support for multiple API versions
6. **Performance**: Caching strategies and optimization
