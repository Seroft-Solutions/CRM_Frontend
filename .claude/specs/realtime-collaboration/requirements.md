# Realtime Collaboration Requirements

## Project Context

Building upon the existing CRM Frontend architecture described in `.claude/specs/complete-implementation-guide.md`, this specification adds comprehensive realtime collaboration capabilities to enable multiple users to work simultaneously on customer data, calls, and meetings.

## User Stories

### 1. Real-time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see live updates when other users modify customer data, so that I'm always working with the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN another user updates a customer record THEN I see the changes reflected in my view within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I'm viewing a customer detail page and another user changes the customer THEN the page updates automatically without refresh
3. IF I'm editing a form and another user changes the same record THEN I receive a notification about the conflict
4. WHEN viewing customer lists THEN new customers added by other users appear automatically
5. WHEN a customer is deleted by another user THEN it disappears from my list view immediately

### 2. User Presence Indicators

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see who else is currently viewing or editing records, so that I can coordinate with my team and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing a customer record THEN I see avatars of other users currently viewing the same record
2. WHEN another user starts editing a record I'm viewing THEN I see an "editing" indicator next to their avatar
3. WHEN I navigate to different pages THEN my presence is updated for other users to see
4. IF a user goes offline THEN their presence indicator disappears within 30 seconds
5. WHEN hovering over a presence indicator THEN I see the user's name and current activity

### 3. Live Meeting Schedule Updates

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see real-time updates to meeting schedules and availability, so that I can make informed scheduling decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN another user books a time slot THEN it becomes unavailable in my scheduling view immediately
2. WHEN viewing the meeting scheduler THEN I see live updates of newly available slots
3. IF a meeting is cancelled by another user THEN the time slot becomes available again automatically
4. WHEN a user's availability changes THEN the meeting scheduler reflects the updates instantly
5. WHEN conflicts arise in double-booking THEN the system shows clear conflict resolution options

### 4. Real-time Notifications

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to receive instant notifications about important changes and events, so that I can respond quickly to critical situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a high-priority customer is assigned to me THEN I receive an immediate notification
2. WHEN a meeting I'm involved in is rescheduled THEN I get a real-time alert
3. IF there are system-wide announcements THEN all active users receive the notification
4. WHEN mentions or @-messages are sent THEN I receive instant alerts
5. WHEN conflicts require my attention THEN I get priority notifications with action options

### 5. Collaborative Form Editing

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to collaborate on forms with other team members in real-time, so that we can work together efficiently on complex customer records.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN multiple users edit the same form THEN we see each other's changes in real-time
2. WHEN another user is typing in a field THEN I see a live typing indicator
3. IF we try to edit the same field simultaneously THEN the system handles the conflict gracefully
4. WHEN one user saves the form THEN other users see the updated data immediately
5. WHEN there are unsaved changes and another user updates the record THEN I'm notified of the conflict

### 6. Live Call Management

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see real-time updates to call statuses and assignments, so that I can coordinate call handling effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a call status changes THEN all users see the update immediately
2. WHEN calls are assigned or reassigned THEN affected users receive instant notifications
3. IF call remarks are added THEN they appear in real-time for all viewers
4. WHEN call priorities change THEN the updates are reflected across all views
5. WHEN integration with meetings occurs THEN all relevant users see the connection immediately

### 7. Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want the system to handle data conflicts intelligently, so that no work is lost when multiple users edit the same information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN edit conflicts occur THEN I see a clear comparison view of changes
2. WHEN I need to resolve conflicts THEN I can choose which changes to keep or merge
3. IF automatic merging is possible THEN it happens without user intervention
4. WHEN manual resolution is required THEN I get guided conflict resolution tools
5. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN all users see the final merged result

### 8. Activity Feed and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to see a live activity feed of changes happening in the system, so that I can stay informed about relevant updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN changes occur to records I follow THEN they appear in my activity feed
2. WHEN I view a customer record THEN I see a live timeline of recent activities
3. IF I need to track specific changes THEN I can filter the activity feed
4. WHEN working on team projects THEN I see team-wide activity updates
5. WHEN important events happen THEN they're highlighted in the activity stream

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Real-time updates must appear within 2 seconds
- WebSocket connections must handle 100+ concurrent users
- System must maintain 99.9% uptime for real-time features
- Memory usage must remain stable during extended sessions

### Scalability
- Support for up to 500 concurrent users
- Horizontal scaling capability for WebSocket servers
- Efficient data synchronization to minimize bandwidth
- Graceful degradation when real-time features are unavailable

### Security
- Real-time data must respect existing RBAC permissions
- WebSocket connections must be authenticated and authorized
- Presence information must not leak sensitive data
- All real-time communications must be encrypted

### Reliability
- Automatic reconnection when connections are lost
- Fallback to polling when WebSockets are unavailable
- Data consistency guarantees across all clients
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Technical Constraints

### Existing Architecture
