# Requirements Document - Admin Group Assignment Fix

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements to fix a critical issue in the organization setup flow where newly created users during organization setup are not being automatically assigned to the "Admins" group in Keycloak. Currently, the system creates organizations and adds users as members, but fails to assign the necessary administrative privileges to the organization creator.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Admin Group Assignment During Organization Creation
**User Story:** As an organization creator, I want to be automatically assigned to the Admins group when I create a new organization, so that I have administrative privileges to manage my organization from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user successfully creates a new organization through the organization setup flow THEN the system SHALL automatically assign that user to the "Admins" group in Keycloak
2. WHEN the organization creation process reaches the user membership step THEN the system SHALL check if an "Admins" group exists for the organization
3. IF the "Admins" group does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it before assigning the user
4. WHEN the admin group assignment fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with the setup process but notify the user of the partial failure
5. WHEN the organization setup completes THEN the user SHALL have both organization membership and admin group membership

### Requirement 2: Admin Group Creation and Management
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically manage admin groups for organizations, so that there is consistent administrative access control across all organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an organization is created THEN the system SHALL ensure an "Admins" group exists in Keycloak for that organization
2. WHEN creating an admin group THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., "Admins" or "{org-name}-Admins")
3. WHEN the admin group creation fails THEN the system SHALL retry once before logging the failure
4. WHEN querying for existing groups THEN the system SHALL use case-insensitive search to find the "Admins" group

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Resilience
**User Story:** As an organization creator, I want the system to handle admin group assignment failures gracefully, so that my organization setup can complete even if there are temporary issues with group management.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN admin group assignment fails during organization setup THEN the system SHALL log the specific error details for troubleshooting
2. WHEN admin group assignment fails THEN the system SHALL continue with the remaining setup steps
3. WHEN the setup completes with admin assignment failure THEN the system SHALL display a warning message to the user about incomplete admin setup
4. WHEN there are Keycloak API errors during group operations THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the user lacks permissions for group operations THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about insufficient privileges

### Requirement 4: Integration with Existing Setup Flow
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin group assignment to integrate seamlessly with the existing organization setup process, so that there are no breaking changes to the current user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the organization setup service runs THEN the admin group assignment SHALL occur after successful user membership addition
2. WHEN the setup progress is displayed THEN the system SHALL include admin group assignment as a visible step
3. WHEN using the existing OrganizationSetupService THEN the admin group assignment SHALL be added without breaking existing functionality
4. WHEN the setup completes THEN all existing completion flows and redirects SHALL continue to work unchanged
5. WHEN there are setup timeouts THEN the admin group assignment SHALL be included in the background completion process

### Requirement 5: Validation and Verification
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that admin group assignments are working correctly, so that I can ensure proper access control is in place.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN organization setup completes successfully THEN the system SHALL verify that the user is assigned to the Admins group
2. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the discrepancy and trigger a corrective action
3. WHEN querying user groups through the API THEN the system SHALL return the user's admin group membership status
4. WHEN there are multiple organizations THEN the system SHALL ensure users are assigned to the correct organization's admin group
5. WHEN testing the fix THEN the system SHALL provide clear success/failure indicators for admin group assignment

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Admin group assignment operations should complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- Group queries should not significantly impact overall organization setup time
- The system should handle concurrent organization creations without group assignment conflicts

### Security
- Group assignment operations must maintain existing authentication and authorization requirements
- Admin group membership should only be granted to verified organization creators
- All group operations must be logged for audit purposes

### Reliability
- Admin group assignment should have a 99% success rate under normal operating conditions
- Failed assignments should not prevent organization setup completion
- The system should recover gracefully from temporary Keycloak service interruptions

## Acceptance Criteria Summary
This bug fix will be considered complete when:
1. ✅ New organization creators are automatically assigned to the "Admins" group
2. ✅ The assignment process is integrated into the existing setup flow
3. ✅ Error handling prevents setup failures due to group assignment issues
4. ✅ The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
5. ✅ Verification mechanisms ensure the assignment was successful
